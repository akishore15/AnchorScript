-- Welcome to AnchorScript.
-- This README file will guide you through the basics of our custom programming language.

-- Variable declaration using 'div'
print("Variable declaration in AnchorScript:")
-- In our language, you declare a variable by using the 'div' keyword.
-- For example, to declare an integer variable:
div int myVariable = 10

-- Printing a variable using 'print<>()'
print("Printing variables in AnchorScript:")
-- You can print variables using the 'print<>()' command.
-- For example, to print the value of 'myVariable':
print<myVariable>

-- Arithmetic Operations
print("Performing arithmetic operations:")
-- You can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
-- Example:
div int result = var(myVariable) * 2
print<result>

-- Logical Operations
print("Performing logical operations:")
-- You can also perform logical operations like comparison.
-- Example:
div bool comparison = var(myVariable) > 5
print<comparison>
